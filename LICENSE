GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you".

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An "aggregate" is a collection of independent works assembled into a
whole.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License applies to the code;
and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
- The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it.
- The work must be licensed as a whole under this License.
- The source code must be made available.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form provided that you also
convey the corresponding source code under the terms of this License.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Additional Terms.

Additional permissions may be added by the copyright holder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Patents.

A contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed that contradict this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Not applicable unless explicitly stated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised versions of the GPL.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability cannot be
given local legal effect, reviewing courts shall apply local law that
most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability.
